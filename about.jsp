  <h4>About Us:</h4>
	  <p>A small domestic appliance, also known as a small electric appliance or minor appliance or simply a small appliance,
	   small domestic or small electric,is a portable or semi-portable machine, generally used on table-tops, 
	   counter-tops or other platforms, to accomplish a household task. Examples include microwave ovens, toasters, 
	   humidifiers, food processors and coffeemakers. They contrast with major appliances (British "white goods"), such
	   as the refrigerator and washing machine, which cannot be easily moved and are generally placed on the floor.
	   Small appliances also contrast with consumer electronics (British "brown goods") which are for leisure and 
	   entertainment rather than purely practical tasks.</p>

     <h3>Uses:</h3>
	  <p>Some small appliances perform the same or similar function as their larger counterparts. 
	  For example, a toaster oven is a small appliance that performs a similar function as an oven.
	  Small appliances often have a home version and a commercial version, for example waffle irons,
	  food processors, and blenders are small household appliances. A food processor will perform the tasks 
	  of chopper, slicer, mixer as well as juicer. Instead of buying multiple small appliances you can buy a
	  single food processor. The commercial, or industrial, version is designed to be used nearly
	  continuously in a restaurant or other similar setting. Commercial appliances are typically connected to a more powerful electrical outlet,
	  are larger and stronger, have more user-serviceable parts, and cost significantly more. 
	  These commercial versions are capable of performing heavy tasks in one go.</p>
